# Panda3D-Game-for-CIS151-Final-Project-
This program was written by Chris Bonner.

This program needs a couple of things to run.

Python 2.6 although 2.7 should work, I have not tried it. Python can be downloaded from http://www.python.org/download/

panda 3d version 1.7.2 which can be downloaded from http://www.panda3d.org/download.php?sdk

This program is buggy and was the final project for CIS151 Game Development level 2.

The program shows collision detection, spawning, shooting and navmesh(navigation AI) using Panda3D.

The controls are as follows:

escape = exit
space = jump
a = left
w = forward
s = backwards
d = right
mouse wheel up and down = change weapons
1 = pistol
2 = shotgun
3 = M4
4 = Scar
left mouse button = fire
